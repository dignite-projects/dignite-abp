# Blazorise Version of Dynamic Form Components

These are a series of dynamic form components developed based on [Blazorise](https://blazorise.com/).

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install the `Dignite.Abp.DynamicForms.Components.BlazoriseUI` NuGet package in your Blazor project.

2. Add the `DigniteAbpDynamicFormsComponentsBlazoriseUiModule` to the `[DependsOn(...)]` property list in your [module class](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics).

With these components, you can easily create dynamic forms for your Blazor application using Blazorise.
